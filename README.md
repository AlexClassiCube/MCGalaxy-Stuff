Stuff for MCGalaxy. Feel free to use any of it. If you have any suggestions for existing commands, please open an issue or send me a message on Discord. I can be found on the [ClassiCube Discord server](https://discord.gg/DvYYyRw).

## Commands
To compile and load:  
· Put the .cs file in **extra/commands/source**

The command will then automatically upon each restart.  

| Name | Description |
| ------------- | -----|
| **LocalSay** | Like /say, but it only broadcasts the message to everyone in the map it's executed from.
