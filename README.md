# MCGalaxy-Stuff
Stuff for MCGalaxy. Feel free to use any of it. If you have any suggestions for existing commands, please open an issue or send me a message on Discord. I can be found on the [ClassiCube Discord server](https://discord.gg/DvYYyRw).

## Commands
To compile and load:

Put the .cs file in *extra/commands/source*
Write */compile [name]*
Write */cmdload [name]*

If you want the commands to load automatically upon start, insert their name (for example `LocalSay`) in *text/cmdautoload.txt*.

| Name | Description |
| ------------- | -----|
| **LocalSay** | Like /say, but it only broadcasts the message to everyone in the map it's executed from.
